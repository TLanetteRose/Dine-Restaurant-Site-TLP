What I Learned -using the picture element with srcset and img to account or responsive sizes and hi-def. -using background-position-x and background-position-y.

02/19/2021: Restarted project; learned about image-set (css) and picture element. 
The image-set() CSS function notation is a method of letting the browser pick the most appropriate CSS image from a given set, primarily for high pixel density screens.

Resolution and bandwidth differ by device and network access. The image-set() function delivers the most appropriate image resolution for a user’s device, providing a set of image options — each with an associated resolution declaration — from which the browser picks the most appropriate for the device and settings.


Learned about Mixins and using values for flex mix in. You set the values based on what you want to do.
